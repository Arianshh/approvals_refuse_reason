# Approval Refuse Reason

## Overview

The Approval Refuse Reason module is a valuable addition to the Odoo approval app, designed to enhance the transparency and communication in approval workflows. With this module, when an approver decides to refuse a request, they are prompted to provide a reason. These refuse reasons are stored and visible in the approver's notebook for each request, ensuring better communication and understanding.

## Key Features

- **Refuse Reason Wizard**: A wizard pops up when an approver refuses a request, prompting them to provide a reason.
- **Reasons in Approver's Notebook**: Refuse reasons are stored and can be viewed in the approver's notebook for each request.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Improve transparency and communication in the approval process by providing clear explanations for request refusals.

## How It Works

The "Approval Refuse Reason" module extends the functionality of the Odoo approval app. When an approver decides to refuse a request, a wizard pops up, prompting the approver to provide a reason for the refusal. These refuse reasons are stored and can be viewed in the approver's notebook for each request. This feature enhances transparency and communication in the approval process, allowing requesters to understand why their request was refused.
